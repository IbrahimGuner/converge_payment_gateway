## Release Date

2017-02-27 0.6.0-rc1

## Supported Platforms

With this release, Converge no longer supports freebsd and solaris.

## Features

This release includes new systemd and unarchive capabilities, improvements to the user resource, and generators for man pages and bash autocomplete.

### Module Improvements

#### Systemd

Support for controlling systemd services has been added via [\#602](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/pull/602).

```hcl
systemd.unit.state "ssh" {
  unit  = "ssh.service"
  state = "running"
}
```

#### Unarchive

Managing several archive formats such as `zip` and `tar.gz` is available through unarchive support in [\#592](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/pull/592).

```hcl
unarchive "consul.zip" {
  source      = "/tmp/consul.zip"
  destination = "/tmp/consul"
}
```

#### User

A user can now be enabled or disabled with the addition of [\#581](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/pull/581).

Additionally, there are updates to the diffs presented for user with [\#584](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/pull/584) and [\#588](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/pull/588).

### Usablilty Enhancements

#### Module Author Improvement

A new helper method has been added to for use with `resource.Status`. `RaiseLevelForDiffs` will raise the status level to `StatusWillChange` if any differences exist via [\#587](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/pull/587).

#### Various Generators

Generators for man pages and bash autocompletion have been added via [\#571](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/pull/571).

Converge is a tool you can use to make various changes on your system. Commands
such as `plan` and `apply` allow you to plan and apply changes to your system,
respectively. Use the `graph` command to visualize the execution of your
changes.

Each command has a dedicated section detailing its use, options, and a listing
of related commands.

Converge has resources you can use to make various changes on your system. For
example, `file.content` will control the content of a file, and `file.mode`
will control a file's mode.

Each resource has a dedicated section detailing use, configuration settings, and
includes an example HCL file.

For more details on how to use the resources, see the
[getting started guide]({{< ref "getting-started.md" >}}).
